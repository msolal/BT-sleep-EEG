Bachelor Thesis - Study of a deep convolutional neural network for temporal sleep stage classification - M. Solal

This repository contains my work for my Bachelor Thesis, where I studied a deep CNN performing temporal sleep staging. 


## Objectives

**Model we studied**: Chambon et al, 2018, A deep learning architecture for temporal sleep stage classification using multivariate and multimodal time series

**Main experiment**: Study how well this model transfers, when being trained on a dataset A and tested on a different dataset B. 

**Side experiments**: Observe differences between datasets, influence of using multiple EEG channels, using multiple modalities etc.


## BIDS Conversion

I also spent quite some time working on converting the datasets I had to the BIDS standard, python scripts for doing so are in the `conversion_to_bids` folder. 


## Documents for more information about my Bachelor Thesis

My **report** is available as a pdf under `SOLAL_BT_Sleep_EEG_Report.pdf` and the tex source code is in the folder `SOLAL BT Sleep EEG Report`.
My **slides** are available as a pdf under `SOLAL_BT_Sleep_EEG_Defense.pdf` and the tex source code is in the folder `SOLAL BT Sleep EEG Defense`.

There also slides for my **lightning talk** (given to the Parietal team) and my **logbook** where I referenced my work throughout the weeks, which I left mainly as a reference for myself.

I am available for any questions about my work by email, at maelysolal@gmail.com
